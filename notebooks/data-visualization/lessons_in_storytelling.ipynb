    "You should tell a story with the previous visuals that you had drawn for your data visualization project. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- Focus on a few visuals that you had drawn in previous sessions.\n",
    "- Design a storyboard for communicating the results of your visuals to the audience.\n",
    "- Write a compelling story based on your storyboard with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n",
    "- Critically evaluate your design decisions. In which scenarios does your story work fine? When and how does it need to be modified?"
