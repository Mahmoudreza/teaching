    "# Contributing to Open Source\n",
    "You should build an open-source project together with your classmates. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- One of the students becomes the project leader (PL).\n",
    "- PL creates a GitHub repository and adds the rest of the teammates as collaborators. \n",
    "- PL introduces the project idea to the rest of the team and distributes tasks among teammates. The project could be, for example, a weblog, where PL focuses on the main page and its style, and the other teammates will focus on the content and design of different articles. \n",
    "- Everyone works on his/her own task and issues a pull request when the task is done.\n",
    "- PL reviews the pull requests and merges them into the master branch if everything is fine."
