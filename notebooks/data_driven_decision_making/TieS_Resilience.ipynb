        "Tie Strength Analysis: Choose a social media platform or online community and analyze the tie strength between individuals or groups within that network. Identify the factors that contribute to tie strength, such as frequency of interaction, shared interests, or emotional intensity. Use social network analysis tools like Gephi or NodeXL to visualize the network and identify key individuals or clusters.\n",

        "Resilience Assessment: Choose a social media platform or online community and assess its resilience to various types of disruptions, such as changes in platform policies, the loss of key members, or the spread of misinformation. Identify the factors that contribute to the network's resilience, such as the diversity of connections, the redundancy of communication channels, or the strength of ties between members.\n",

        "Interventions for Building Resilience: Develop an intervention plan to promote resilience within a social media network or online community. This could include strategies for increasing tie strength between members, promoting diversity of connections, or building redundancy in communication channels. Use social network analysis tools to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention and measure changes in the network's resilience over time.\n",

        "Tie Strength and Information Spread: Analyze the relationship between tie strength and the spread of information within a social media network or online community. Identify the types of information that are most likely to spread through weak or strong ties, and assess the impact of tie strength on the speed and reach of information dissemination. Use social network analysis tools to visualize the flow of information within the network and identify key individuals or clusters.\n",

        "Building Strong Communities: Develop a plan for building a strong and resilient social media community or online network. This could include strategies for identifying and connecting key individuals, promoting shared interests and values, and fostering emotional connections between members. Use social network analysis tools to evaluate the effectiveness of the community-building plan and measure changes in the network's tie strength and resilience over time."
