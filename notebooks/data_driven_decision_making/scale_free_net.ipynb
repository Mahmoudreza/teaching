        "Network visualization: Use a tool like NetworkX or Gephi to generate and visualize random networks. Experiment with different types of random networks (e.g. Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert) and different network parameters (e.g. number of nodes, edge density) to see how the resulting networks look.\n",
