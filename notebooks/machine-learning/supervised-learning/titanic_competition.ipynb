    "# Titanic Competition\n",
    "You should build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict survivors of the Titanic disaster and participate in the corresponding Kaggle competition. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- Read the Titanic competition page on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).\n",
    "- Load the `titanic` dataset using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html). You can find this dataset in the datasets folder.\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training and test sets using [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html).\n",
    "- Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including all necessary steps, to have a running solution with some performance.\n",
    "- Collaborate with your groupmates to finalize your pipeline by\n",
    "    - reading the discussion forum to learn from other community members;\n",
    "    - discussing the bottlenecks of your current solution;\n",
    "    - running experiments on your pipeline;\n",
    "    - improving the performance of your pipeline.\n",
    "- Test the best pipeline on the test set and report various [evaluation metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/model_evaluation.html).  \n",
    "- Present your pipeline.\n",
    "- Submit your predictions to Kaggle."
