    "# Text Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "You should collect and preprocess some textual data to investigate what is `GISMA` and how people perceive this brand on social media. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- Request and receive the [About GISMA](https://www.gisma.com/school/about-us) web page using [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "- Extract and clean up the main content of this web page using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).\n",
    "- Create a free [Twitter developer account](http://apps.twitter.com/) to get access to the Twitter API.\n",
    "- Build a client application to work with the Twitter API using [Tweepy](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/).\n",
    "- Search for the latest tweets about `GISMA` and clean up their content.\n",
    "- Considering these collected textual data from two different sources (GISMA's website and Twitter), what can you say about this brand?"
