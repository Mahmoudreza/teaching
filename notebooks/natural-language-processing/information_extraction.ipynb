    "You should extract keyphrases and named entities from unstructured texts using different approaches. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- Suppose the given string variable is the content of your document.\n",
    "- Extract the keyphrases of your document using some unsupervised algorithms, such as `TextRank` and `SGRank`. The implementation of these algorithms can be found in [`textaCy`](https://textacy.readthedocs.io/en/0.12.0/api_reference/extract.html).\n",
    "- Recognize named entities of your document using pretrained models. These pretrained models can be found in [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features) and [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/task_summary#named-entity-recognition).\n",
    "- Compare the result of different approaches. Analyze the effect of hyperparameters on the quality of results."
