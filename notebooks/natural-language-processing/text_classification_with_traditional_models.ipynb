    "# Text Classification with Traditional Models\n",
    "The Twitter dataset (`tweets.csv`) was collected in February of 2015. Contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as \"late flight\" or \"rude service\"). The dataset can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should build an end-to-end NLP pipeline to predict the sentiment class (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral) given a tweet. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- Load the `tweets` dataset using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html). You can find this dataset in the datasets folder.\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training and test sets using [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html).\n",
    "- Build an end-to-end NLP pipeline, including a text representation model, such as [TF-IDF vectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html), and a traditional classification model, such as [naive bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html).\n",
    "- Optimize your pipeline by cross-validating your design decisions. \n",
    "- Test the best pipeline on the test set and report various [evaluation metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/model_evaluation.html).  \n",
    "- Check the documentation to identify the most important hyperparameters, attributes, and methods of the model. Use them in practice."
