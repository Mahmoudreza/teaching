    "# Text Summarization\n",
    "You should summarize unstructured texts using different approaches. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- Suppose the given string variable is the content of your document.\n",
    "- Do extractive text summarization; \n",
    "    - Using unsupervised algorithms, such as `TextRank` and `LSA`. The implementation of these algorithms can be found in [`Sumy`](https://pypi.org/project/sumy/).\n",
    "    - Using pretrained models. These pretrained models can be found in [Bert Extractive Summarizer](https://pypi.org/project/bert-extractive-summarizer/).\n",
    "- Do abstractive text summarization using pretrained models. These pretrained models can be found in [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/task_summary#summarization).\n",
    "- Compare the result of different approaches. Analyze the effect of hyperparameters on the quality of results."
