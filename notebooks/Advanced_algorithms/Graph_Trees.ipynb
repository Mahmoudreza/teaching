    "Write a program Maze.java that takes a command-line argument n, and generates a random n-by-n perfect maze. A maze is perfect if it has exactly one path between every pair of points in the maze, i.e., no inaccessible locations, no cycles, and no open spaces. Here's a nice algorithm to generate such mazes. Consider an n-by-n grid of cells, each of which initially has a wall between it and its four neighboring cells. For each cell (x, y), maintain a variable north[x][y] that is true if there is wall separating (x, y) and (x, y + 1). We have analogous variables east[x][y], south[x][y], and west[x][y] for the corresponding walls. Note that if there is a wall to the north of (x, y) then north[x][y] = south[x][y+1] = true. Construct the maze by knocking down some of the walls as follows:\n",

    "a: Start at the lower level cell (1, 1).\n",
    "b: Find a neighbor at random that you haven't yet been to.\n",
    "c: If you find one, move there, knocking down the wall. If you don't find one, go back to the previous cell.\n",
    "d: Repeat steps ii. and iii. until you've been to every cell in the grid.\n",
    "Hint: maintain an (n+2)-by-(n+2) grid of cells to avoid tedious special cases."

We define a cocyclicity equivalence relation on the edges: two edges e1 and e2 are are in same biconnected component if e1 = e2 or there exists a cycle containing both e1 and e2. Two biconnected components share at most one vertex in common. A vertex is an articulation point if and only if it is common to more than one biconnected component. Program Biconnected.py identifies the bridges and articulation points."
