    "1- Local minimum in an array. Write a program that, given an array a[] of n distinct integers, finds a local minimum: an index i such that botha[i] < a[i-1] and a[i] < a[i+1] (assuming the neighboring entry is in bounds). Your program should use ~ 2 lg n compares in the worst case.\n",

Given an n-by-n array a[] of n2 distinct integers, design an algorithm that runs in time proportional to n log n to find a local minimum: an pair of indices i and j such that a[i][j] < a[i+1][j], a[i][j] < a[i][j+1], a[i][j] < a[i-1][j], and a[i][j] < a[i][j-1] (assuming the neighboring entry is in bounds).\n",

    "Binary search with only addition and subtraction. [Mihai Patrascu] Write a program that, given an array of n distinct integers in ascending order, determines whether a given integer is in the array. You may use only additions and subtractions and a constant amount of extra memory. The running time of your program should be proportional to log n in the worst case.\n",
    "Answer: Instead of searching based on powers of two (binary search), use Fibonacci numbers (which also grow exponentially). Maintain the current search range to be [i, i + F(k)] and keep F(k), F(k-1) in two variables. At each step compute F(k-2) via subtraction, check element i + F(k-2), and update the range to either [i, i + F(k-2)] or [i + F(k-2), i + F(k-2) + F(k-1)].\n",
