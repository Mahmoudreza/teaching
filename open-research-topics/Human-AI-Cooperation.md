# Human AI Cooperation on Dynamic Networks
how AI affects human life, and how humans trust AI, which ended up working on an interesting problem of how humans and AI cooperate dynamics networks.
Adam Grant, in his book [give and take], claims that human who cooperates will end up being more successful than those who do not. However, recently AI has increasingly become an important part of human life. In which AI may interact as same as a human. Thus, these interesting questions were raised:
- Do humans trust AI?
 	- Will people who are better able to cooperate with machines obtain higher long-term benefits than those who cannot?
 We have already demonstrated that people, on average, distrust machines in the repeated prisoners dilemma. But some people may not exhibit such bias against machines and thus may be more likely than others to reap the benefits of human-machine cooperation.
If people play on dynamic networks, people who are averse to machines may dump them and cooperate only with humans, only to suffer in the long term.
Can we demonstrate that networks bifurcate into a 'world' (i.e., clique) of only humans, and a 'world' of humans and AIs, where the latter experiences more cooperation on average?
To answer this vital question, we are going to develop an experiment in which we put humans and AIs in dynamic networks and ask them to interact with each other for several rounds. In the end, by studying the structure of networks and the score of each human, we can see if the network bifurcates into two groups of humans (group of humans who cooperate with AI and who do not). We also can explore if any group gains a long-term benefit from their actions.
 Accordingly, we are developing our experiment on the Emperica framework and will ask people on the Prolific platform [https://www.prolific.co/] (Online participant recruitment for surveys and market research) to participate in our experiments.
