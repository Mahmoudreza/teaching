# Data Cleaning for Machine Learning
Data cleaning is an important and time-consuming step of any data science pipeline. Previous research has considered data cleaning as an isolated step. In fact, many proposed data cleaning systems try to improve the quality of the data regardless of its impact on the final performance of the machine learning model.

This project aims at designing and implementing a new data cleaning system that takes the performance of the machine learning model into account. Therefore, this data cleaning system will automatically find the best data cleaning techniques to maximize the final performance of the machine learning model.
