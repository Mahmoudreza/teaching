# Social Media-Based Trend Prediction
Users' posts on social media platforms (like Twitter) reflect different news, views, and opinions. Some of these posts might contain valuable signals to predict future trends, such as the outbreak of epidemy, traffic jams in a city, stock prices of a company, or the energy consumption of a country.

This project aims at designing and implementing a new system that continuously collects and analyses social media posts to predict future events more accurately.        


## Requirements

- Interest in technical challenges of designing, implementing, and benchmarking new approaches.
- Expertise in related technical topics, including data science, machine learning, and NLP.   


## Expected Outcomes 
- A master thesis to be written according to the university's guidelines.
- A research paper to be published in top data science conferences/journals.
- An open-source project to be released on GitHub.
