# Fair Autonomous Vehicles
Traditionally vehicles such as cars, bicycles, motorcycles, etc., were completely under human control. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence, many car manufacturers have been starting to produce autonomous cars. They are constantly developing their own systems and policies for autonomous car control, which may lead to different behaviors in the same situation. This brings attention to the autonomous car policies because they could cause harm to different road users, such as cyclists, pedestrians, passengers, etc., with different kinds of probability distributions. For instance, in May 2016, a Tesla Autopilot car crashed, and the occupant of the car was killed. Tesla explained: “Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.” In March 2018, the first automated car crash that killed a pedestrian occurred.
One considerable worry is how third parties such as regulatory authorities could define a total policy for the environment. In this regard, the regulation could have more control over the distribution of the accidents which might be along or against car manufacture policy for their car. For instance, what if regulatory authorities, which may be based on most people's preferences and road users' distribution, decide to distribute people's death (Figure 3)? What do they do? Is it possible to achieve it or not?

To investigate this problem, we need to define an optimization problem that includes two parties optimizing different things:
 
2.3 Regulatory authority
We want to help the regulatory authority solve the following optimization problem:
Objective function: They have a target distribution of accident fatalities over different road users (cyclists, pedestrians, passengers, etc.)
Actions: They can choose the legal fines or victim compensation to allocate for different road users for different kinds of accidents.
Given that:
Objective function: The car manufacturer wants to minimize the financial liability (the amount of fines, financial compensation, etc., imposed by the regulatory authority) from its fleet of vehicles.
Actions: The car manufacturer can design decisions that affect the distribution of accidents of their cars (e.g., how to position the car in the lane, but there are other examples, of course).
