# Clean Text Extraction from PDF
PDF is a popular file type to publish reports. However, PDF was never designed to be an input data source. That is why text extractors cannot extract clean text from many PDF files. 

This project aims at designing and implementing a new system that post-processes the result of PDF text extractors and generates a final clean text.                


## Requirements
- Interest in conducting genuine research and pursuing a research/PhD path after graduation.
- Interest in technical challenges of designing, implementing, and benchmarking new approaches.
- Expertise in related technical topics, including data science, machine learning, and NLP.   


## Expected Outcomes 
- A master thesis to be written according to the university's guidelines.
- A research paper to be published in top data science conferences/journals.
- An open-source project to be released on GitHub. 


## Contact Person
- Prof. Dr. Mohammad Mahdavi
